Liter font is neo-grotesque in the spirit of the Swiss school of the new generation. At the beginning it was created for digital screens, and worked excellently in small font sizes 14-16. Designed to be a typesetting workhorse It has low contrast and little difference in height between uppercase and lowercase characters. Supports Cyrillic and Latin alphabet

If you want to build fonts manually on your own computer:

* `make build` will produce font files.
* `make test` will run [FontBakery](https://github.com/googlefonts/fontbakery)'s quality assurance tests.
* `make proof` will generate HTML proof files.

The proof files and QA tests are also available automatically via GitHub Actions - look at https://skugiz.github.io/liter.
