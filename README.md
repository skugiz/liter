Liter font is neo-grotesque in the spirit of the Swiss school of the new generation. At the beginning it was created for digital screens, and worked excellently in small font sizes 14-16. Designed to be a typesetting workhorse It has low contrast and little difference in height between uppercase and lowercase characters. Supports Cyrillic and Latin alphabet
